<h1 align="center">¡Hola!👋 I'm Ignacio. </h1>

- 👋 I'm an NLP Engineer and Computer Science working at Fever. I live, study, work, suffer the scorching summers and have fun in Madrid, Spain.
- 🧑🏼‍💻 I believe that we, the CS folks, should work towards enhancing human life. That's why I mainly focus on AI & Data Science, especially Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
- 🌱 And, outside of my computer, I love Liberal Arts and Humanities. I almost studied something along that line as my BSc! I have been lucky enough to be able to also educate myself in topics like Languages, Mythology, Anthropology, History, and European Culture. That's why NLP was love at first sight.
- ✊🏽 Deep Learning and NLP are amazing tools to fight for social causes. During my BSc, both my MSc and my time in Argilla, I worked on Misogyny Detection using Transformers. Thanks to a lot of amazing people, I made two theses on the topic, and I'm quite proud of them. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ignacioct/Temis/blob/main/thesis.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/ignacioct/MedicalInformationExtractionUsingNLP/blob/main/Thesis%20Ignacio.pdf).
- ☄️ Alongside my education, I've spent some time volunteering, focusing on empowering people. In UC3M, I have helped in [Technovation Challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org), trying to help high school girls interested in STEM to learn the basics of programming. I was also an organizer at [IT Camp for Piger](https://itcamp.dk) in Aarhus Universitet, a three-day camp where young girls interested in CS can get a bite on what we study and meet some relevant women figures in the Danish industry and academia. I also write, translate, and proofread for the Spanish edition of [Last Week in Denmark](https://lastweekdk.substack.com/p/last-week-in-denmark-1809-2509-episode), where we make it easy for the 11% of internationals in the country to read about what happens in Politics, Economy, Society, and Culture.
- 🌟 In my free time, I like to travel, hike, climb, write, read, run, and discover new places.
