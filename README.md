<h1 align="center">Hello there!👋 I'm Ignacio. </h1>

- 👋 I'm an MSc student in Computer Science and a Student Worker in Vestas. I live, study, work, take D vitamin pills and have fun in Aarhus, Denmark.
-👩🏽‍🧑🏼‍💻 I believe that us, the CS folks, should work towards enhancing human life. That's why I mainly focus on AI & Data Science, specially Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
- 🌱 And, outside of my computer, I love Liberal Arts and Humanities. I almost studied something along that line as my BSc! I have been lucky enough to be able to also educate myself in topics like languages, mithology, antrophology, History and European Culture. That's why NLP was love at first sight.
- 🌟 In my free time, I like to travel, hike, climb, run and discovering new places. Right now I'm wandering around Denmark, trying to meet the people, know the culture and learn the language.
