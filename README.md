<h1 align="center">Hej hej!👋 I'm Ignacio. </h1>

- 👋 I'm an MSc student in Computer Science and a Student Worker in Vestas. I live, study, work, take D vitamin pills and have fun in Aarhus, Denmark.
- 🧑🏼‍💻 I believe that we, the CS folks, should work towards enhancing human life. That's why I mainly focus on AI & Data Science, especially Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
- 🌱 And, outside of my computer, I love Liberal Arts and Humanities. I almost studied something along that line as my BSc! I have been lucky enough to be able to also educate myself in topics like languages, mythology, anthropology, History and European Culture. That's why NLP was love at first sight.
- ✊🏽 Deep Learning and NLP are amazing tools to fight for social causes. During my BSc and my internship in Recognai, I worked on Misogyny Detection using Transformers. Thanks to a lot of amazing people, I made my thesis on the topic, and I'm quite proud of it. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ignacioct/Temis/blob/main/thesis.pdf).
- ☄️ Alongside my education, I've spent some time volunteering, focusing on empowering people. In UC3M, I have helped in [Technovation Challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org), trying to help high school girls interested in STEM to learn the basics of programming. Right now, I'm an organizer at [IT Camp for piger](https://itcamp.dk) in Aarhus Universitet, a three-day camp where young girls interested in CS can get a bite on what we study and meet some relevant women figures in the Danish industry and academia. I also write, translate and proofread for the Spanish edition of [Last Week in Denmark](https://lastweekdk.substack.com/p/last-week-in-denmark-1809-2509-episode), where we make it easy for the 11% of internationals in the country to read about what happens in Politics, Economy, Society, and Culture in Denmark.
- 🌟 In my free time, I like to travel, hike, climb, run and discover new places. Right now I'm wandering around Denmark, trying to meet the people, know the culture and learn the language.
